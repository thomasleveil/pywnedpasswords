# pywnedPasswords

This script uses the pwnedpasswords.com v2 api to check your password in
a secure way (using the [K-anonymity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity) method)

The full Hash is never transmitted over the wire, only the first 5 characters.
The comparison happens offline.

Special thanks to Troy Hunt ([@troyhunt](https://twitter.com/troyhunt)) for making this script possible.

## Usage

``` bash
python pwnedcheck.py
```

Insert your password when asked.

the output will either be:

```
Password to check: 
Found your password 47205 times.
```

or in case your password is not secure

```
Password to check: 
Your password did not appear in PwnedPasswords yet.
```
